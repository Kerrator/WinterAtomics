# Teaching

I teach and support early-year labs and tutorials with a focus on clarity, reproducible computation, and constructive feedback. Students move from analytical solutions to small Python scripts that test assumptions, residuals, and numerical error. I value accessibility, readable figures, and practical problem-solving.

## Teaching Philosophy

My approach emphasizes:
- **Clear expectations:** Set standards early and provide transparent rubrics
- **Hands-on support:** Work alongside students to build confidence
- **Analytical foundations:** Connect paper-and-pencil methods to computational implementations
- **Reproducibility:** Teach version control, documentation, and verification habits
- **Constructive feedback:** Use formative assessments and peer explanation

## Teaching Interests

- Numerical methods in Python
- Data fitting and uncertainty quantification
- Active tutorials and problem-based learning
- Rubric-based feedback for transparent grading
- Responsible use of AI and language models in coursework
- Accessible materials and inclusive teaching practices

## Courses Supported

I have extensive experience supporting first- and second-year laboratory and tutorial courses in engineering and applied sciences. I enjoy mentoring students in rigorous, reproducible computation and helping them develop problem-solving skills that transfer across disciplines.
