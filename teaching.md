# Teaching

I teach and support early-year labs and tutorials with a focus on clarity, reproducible computation, and constructive feedback. Students move from analytical solutions to small Python scripts that test assumptions, residuals, and numerical error. I value accessibility, readable figures, and practical problem-solving.

## Teaching Philosophy

My approach emphasizes:
- **Clear expectations:** Set standards early and provide transparent rubrics
- **Hands-on support:** Work alongside students to build confidence
- **Analytical foundations:** Connect paper-and-pencil methods to computational implementations
- **Reproducibility:** Teach version control, documentation, and verification habits
- **Constructive feedback:** Use formative assessments and peer explanation

## Teaching Interests

- Numerical methods in Python
- Data fitting and uncertainty quantification
- Active tutorials and problem-based learning
- Rubric-based feedback for transparent grading
- Responsible use of AI and language models in coursework
- Accessible materials and inclusive teaching practices

## Teaching Experience

### Queen's University (2024–present)

**MECH 479 Nanomaterials** (Instructor + TA, 2024/2025, 20–40 students)
Interactive lectures on materials simulation, molecular dynamics, and computational nanoscience. Designed cross-platform tutorials emphasizing reproducible workflows, version control, and verification of numerical results.

**MECH 272 Materials** (Lab TA, Winter 2025)
Undergraduate materials laboratory supporting hands-on characterization and testing methods.

**CHEM 112 General Chemistry II** (Lab TA, Winter 2025)
Laboratory instruction for first-year engineering and science students.

### Ontario Tech University (2021–2024)

**Winter 2023** (Full TA load: ~1,600 reports and quizzes marked in one term)
- **CHEM 1800U Chemistry for Engineers** (9 lab sections, ~20 students each)
- **CHEM 1020U Chemistry II** (4 lab sections)
- **CHEM 1010U Chemistry I** (2 labs + 4 tutorials, ~20–45 students each)
- **Science Café** (Weekly drop-in support, 5–15 students per session)

Additional terms included coordination of multiple CHEM 1010U and 1020U lab sections, development of comment banks for efficient feedback, and mentoring of undergraduate peer tutors. Emphasized reproducible computation, academic integrity, and hands-on problem-solving across all courses.
