# Research

I study atomic-scale mechanisms in alloys and related systems using density-functional theory and molecular dynamics. Current interests include point defects, diffusion, grain-boundary structure, and structure–property links relevant to engineering materials.

## Methods & Tools

**Simulation Methods:**
- Density-functional theory (DFT)
- Molecular dynamics (MD)
- Classical potentials and force-field development

**Software:**
- Quantum ESPRESSO
- LAMMPS
- NWChem

**Data Analysis & Workflow:**
- Python (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Git for version control
- Linux/HPC environments with SLURM scheduling
- LaTeX for technical writing
- VESTA and XCrySDen for visualization

## Research Interests

- Point defects and their energetics
- Diffusion mechanisms in metallic alloys
- Grain-boundary structure and properties
- Structure–property relationships in engineering materials
- Atomistic mechanisms in catalytic systems
