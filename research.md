# Research

I study atomic-scale mechanisms in alloys and related systems using density-functional theory and molecular dynamics. My work connects defect behavior, segregation, and transport properties to macroscopic material performance in engineering applications.

## Current Research

**Chromium Effects in Nickel-Based Alloys** (PhD, Queen's University, 2024–present)

Investigating how chromium influences vacancy concentration and grain-boundary aluminum segregation in Ni–Cr–Al alloys using DFT and molecular dynamics. This work addresses fundamental questions about oxidation resistance in high-temperature superalloys and the interplay between alloying elements, point defects, and grain-boundary chemistry.

## Previous Research

**Ion-Pair Trapping in Functionalized Organic Systems** (MSc, Ontario Tech, 2021–2023)

Applied quantum chemistry methods (DFT, Hartree-Fock, MP2) to model noncovalently bound molecular complexes and ion-pair trapping mechanisms in functionalized cyclic hydrocarbons. Explored potential applications in energy storage and light detection.

**Synthetic Chemistry** (Ontario Tech, 2016–2018)

Laboratory experience with organic synthesis, NMR spectroscopy, UV-Vis characterization, and GC-MS analysis supporting research in molecular systems and functionalized materials.
