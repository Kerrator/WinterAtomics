# About

Stephen Kerr is a PhD candidate in computational materials science at Queen's University (supervisor: Laurent Karim Béland). His work applies atomistic simulation—principally density-functional theory and molecular dynamics—to understand defect formation, transport, and stability in engineering alloys and related catalytic systems. He uses tools such as Quantum ESPRESSO, LAMMPS, and NWChem alongside Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) on Linux/HPC environments with SLURM.

Stephen teaches and supports early-year laboratory and tutorial courses, emphasising clear expectations, hands-on help, and the link between analytical methods and small, testable Python scripts. He values reproducibility, readable figures, and constructive feedback. Outside research and teaching, he experiments with local language models and generative tools to develop safer, verifiable workflows for learning and scientific communication.
